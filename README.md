# SLP Assignment 1 - Word2Vec Model Training and Visualization

## Overview
This project focuses on training a **Word2Vec** model using the `gensim` library. It includes word embedding visualization using **PCA** and **t-SNE** and evaluates the model through word similarity and analogy tasks.

## Features
- ✅ **Train Word2Vec Model** on a sample dataset.
- 🔍 **Word Embedding Exploration** - Retrieve vectors and find similar words.
- 📊 **Visualization:**
  - PCA for dimensionality reduction.
  - t-SNE for advanced 2D projection.
- 📈 **Evaluation Methods:**
  - Intrinsic evaluation (word similarity, analogies).
  - Placeholder for extrinsic evaluation (downstream tasks like classification).
- 💾 **Model Saving & Loading:** Save and reload the trained model.

## Installation
To run the script, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install --upgrade gensim nltk matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python 201_slp_assignment1.py
   ```
4. View model training outputs and visualizations.

## Expected Outputs
- Console logs for vocabulary, word similarities, and analogy results.
- Saved model file: `word2vec_model.bin`.
- PCA and t-SNE visualization plots.
